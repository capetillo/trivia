## WHO WANTS TO BE A FULL-STACK DEVELOPER

Who Wants To Be A Full-Stack Developer is a 5-question trivia game inspired by Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. The questions theme are related to software engineering and they ascend in difficulty. You have 15 seconds to answer question 1, 30 seconds to answer question 2-3, and 45 seconds to answer questions 4-5. If you answer incorrectly, the game ends but you have the option to play again by clicking the replay button. You win when you answer all 5 questions correctly.

## NEXT STEPS

Future steps include adding a scoreboard, the question number, a better designed timer, and getting the randomizer of questions to actually work. A lifeline button, a 50:50 button, and an audience button will be added as well. The lifeline button will display the right answer, the 50:50 button will display the right answer and the wrong answer, and the function of the audience button is yet to be determined. These buttons will only be available once.
