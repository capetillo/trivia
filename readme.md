A README.md file with these sections:

☐ <Your game's title>: A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.
MY GAME IS A TRIVIA GAME WITH A THEME OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING QUESTIONS. THE QUESTIONS ARE RELATED TO CODING BECAUSE IN RESEARCHING THE QUESTIONS, I LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW MY OWN GAME IS OPERATING. THE QUESTIONS HAVE AN ASCENDING RANGE IN DIFFICULTY. YOU HAVE 15 SECONDS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 1, 30 SECONDS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 2 AND 3, AND 45 SECONDS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 4 AND 5. IF YOU ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS CORRECTLY, YOU WIN THE GAME. IF YOU ANSWER A QUESTION INCORRECTLY, YOU LOSE BUT HAVE THE OPTION OF STARTING OVER AGAIN. 
☐ Screenshot(s): Images of your actual game.
TBD

☐ Technologies Used: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...
